// Embuni ELC — Role catalogue and role-permission matrix.
// This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for which role has which permissions.
// Used by `prisma/seed.ts` to populate Role, Permission, RolePermission tables.
//
// To add a permission to a role: edit the array below. The seed will reconcile
// the DB to match this file (idempotent — safe to re-run).
//
// Principles:
// - Every authenticated Leader gets the COMMON set.
// - Each executive role adds module-specific perms for its responsibility.
// - Year-1 reps are SCOPED by gender cohort (no cross-cohort visibility).
// - Super Admin has everything.
// - VP delegates from President (default: same as President, can be reduced
//   in production by editing this file).
